    "Vaccination is widely recognized as one of the most significant achievements in public health, having successfully eradicated or controlled numerous infectious diseases. Despite this progress, recent years have seen a troubling rise in vaccine skepticism, which has contributed to declining immunization rates and the resurgence of preventable diseases. Understanding the underlying factors driving vaccine hesitancy, as well as accurately predicting vaccination uptake, is therefore critical for public health officials and policymakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS 2009) to predict individuals’ likelihood of receiving the H1N1 influenza vaccine. By analyzing historical vaccination patterns and associated demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal factors, the study seeks to provide insights into vaccination decision-making. These insights are particularly relevant in the context of emerging and ongoing global health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where vaccine acceptance plays a central role in disease control and prevention."

    "Vaccine hesitancy represents a major challenge to public health initiatives, as it contributes to reduced immunization coverage and heightened susceptibility to infectious disease outbreaks. Gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that influence individuals’ vaccination decisions is essential for developing targeted interventions and strengthening community immunity. Within this context, this project seeks to predict individuals’ likelihood of receiving the H1N1 influenza vaccine by applying machine learning techniques to data obtained from the National H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS 2009)."

    "- Prediction: Develop and apply machine learning models to predict individuals’ likelihood of receiving the H1N1 influenza vaccine based on demographic, socio-economic, and attitudinal characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identification of Influential Factors: Identify and quantify the key determinants of H1N1 vaccine acceptance, including healthcare provider recommendations, health insurance status, perceptions of vaccine effectiveness, and individual risk perceptions related to H1N1 infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Evaluation: Evaluate and compare the predictive performance of multiple machine learning algorithms—namely Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier—in predicting H1N1 vaccine uptake.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact Analysis: Examine the practical implications of the predictive models and extract actionable insights that can inform public health strategies and policy interventions aimed at increasing vaccination coverage."
